## Game Rules

Othello is played on an 12x12 grid. The game pieces, called "disks," are black(x) on one side and white(o) on the other. The game begins with eight disks placed in across two squares in the centers of the grid, with two black disks diagonally opposite each other and two white disks diagonally opposite each other.

Players take turns placing disks on the board. To place a disk, a player must position it so that it surrounds at least one of the opponent's disks in a straight line. This means that the player's disk must be placed in such a way that there is a straight line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) of the opponent's disks between the newly placed disk and another one of the player's disks. When a player surrounds the opponent's disks in this manner, all of the surrounded disks are flipped to the player's color.

The game continues until the grid is filled or neither player can make a legal move. The player with the most disks of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

For more detailed rules and strategies, you can refer to [Othello's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).
